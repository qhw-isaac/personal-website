                        <h3>MFRE Begins</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first week of my Master's summer bootcamp had just concluded. Perhaps it is a blessing that I only began sharing these notes now; I have been bored out of my mind the past 2 months as I finished Calculus I in June. Should I have shared these notes any earlier, I would be no less than polluting this brand new corner of the internet. As I digress, my rediscovery of Mathematics has brought me some of the greatest joys this past year. Thankfully, this summer bootcamp has been very intellectually enriching in its absence. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Interestingly, I've found myself struggling to connect socially more than I did before. I'm uncertain if it's due to any external circumstances or if I'm molding into the stereotype of the "nerd" I've become. One thing I know for certain is I need to stop correcting professors in class before they conjure an aversive response when they see me raise my hand; it's so hard to help it though, seeing broken patterns irks me! Alas, let the metamorphosis begin; I hope I come out the other side a person I continue to be proud of.

                        <h3>Formal Logic - Final Exam</h3>
                        <p>
                            I've been humbled. Though there is a great lesson or perhaps a much needed reminder here before I fully embrace Economics. The one proof that stumped me was the simplest; rather than trying to prove the consequent through assuming 40 iterations of rearranged possibilities of the premises under a conditional proof, all I needed to do was to reject the conclusion and find a contradiction, making the conclusion true through an indirect proof. Intuitively, I can feel the lesson ruminating... sometimes the conclusion is so believable yet cannot be proven that we just have to consider the possibility that it cannot be false. I've attached the proof below. Another one for the vault of questions I've missed on an exam that I will never forget!

                        <h3>Networking Barbecue</h3>
                        <p>
                            I met Cam, an entrepreneur in residence at Innovation UBC, at a barbecue hosted by my partner's friend. The barbecue itself was interesting, 
                            an amalgamation of friends but also for the purposes of social networking... not particularly an environment I enjoy. 
                            However, my conversation with Cam did inspire me to consider the fact that perhaps I'm lost amongst the four paths laid out before me (academia, government, NGO, and industry) 
                            because none of which fully satisfies me, at least as an working enconomist. 
                            Cam suggested the possibility that I could try and merge my experience in leadership and entrepreneurship with my passion for animal welfare and knowledge in economics into some type of scalable product. 
                            This is super fascinating as I ruminate on my MFRE graduating project; perhaps I could pivot towards gaining experience
                            that allows me to design a product that can both benefit industry and better animal welfare. Lots to think about!

                        <h3>Dr. Jayson Lusk</h3>
                        <p>
                            I reached out to Dr. Lusk, an academic economist who has published plenty in Animal Welfare Economics a few days back for some advice as I navigate through some much needed decisions for the next few years. To my surprise, he responded! The gist of the story is that successful trailblazers in economics were often scrutinized before they were successful, particularly in the field of experimental economics. He kindly shared some words of encouragement which I believe I will hold onto for the foreseeable future.

                        <p>
                            I met with Lisa this morning to discuss animal welfare and economics, and was met with one of the kindest people I've had the pleasure of knowing. She was incredibly sharp yet welcoming, and encouraged me to continue in the path that I am on. 

                            My experience speaking with various professors working in economics and animal welfare has been conflicting, but eye opening to the kind of advisor I want to become (should I end up pursuing academia). I am confident in my intellectual abilities, but regardless of so, encouragement and acknowledgement goes a long way… not something I've experienced in all of my interactions with potential mentors.

                            This chat may be insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but it was the first conversation where my ideas and ambitions felt real. If Jayson showed me that lighting a fire was possible, then Lisa sparked it; I can only hope the heat from this fire can make the cows' life a little bit better.

                        <p>
                            I had the privilege of visiting Ruckle Heritage Farm on Salt Spring Island the last weekend before school began. 
                            It wasn't necessarily planned to center the trip around agriculture, but it ended up being quite an eye-opening experience.
                            The folks we stayed with at the farm (Marjorie, Mike, Matt, and Abey) gave us a tour and shared their family's history managing the land.
                            It was incredible witnessing a farm centered around the philosophy of sustainable agriculture and land stewardship both succeed and thrive.
                            It was even moreso incredible to see animals in agriculture living as part of a greater ecosystem that the folks running the farm
                            consider themselves to be a part of.

                        <p>
                            It's been about a week since I wrote my last final exam for the first term of my Master's program. I've had a fantastic time this past semester with the program pushing me to my limits and myself personally nudging me right onto the edge of the cliff with my extracurriculars; thankfully, I did not fall off.

                            While grades are not reflective of a person's worth, they hold special meaning to me as they are a direct reflection of how far I've come. I'm happy to say that I was able to achieve an overall A+ for the term - I hope to continue this into the future. Here's to also hoping for more frequent journal entries...
